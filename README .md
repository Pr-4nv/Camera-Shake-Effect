# Camera Shake effect
The CameraShake script, designed for Unity, provides a dynamic shaking effect for the camera, enhancing the visual impact of events like explosions. The shake intensity is controlled using an animation curve, and the effect duration and strength can be customized. The script initiates the shaking effect when the start flag is set to true, making it easy to integrate with other game mechanics.


## Features

- Customizable Animation Curve:  Use an animation curve to finely control the intensity of the shake over time. This allows for transitions and varied shake profiles to suit different scenarios.

-  Adjustable Duration : Set the duration of the camera shake to fit the specific needs of your scene, from short bursts to prolonged tremors.
- Shake Strength Control: Easily adjust the overall strength of the shake to match the intensity of the event triggering the shake.
- Random Position Variation:  Introduce randomness to the shake with the randomPos parameter, providing a more natural and less predictable camera movement.
